                            <p>We decided to migrate to Hetzner Falkenstein Sachsen, DE. All peers and infohashes data will be lost. Because Cloudflare CDN is used, you will not notice the change.</p>

                            <p>In order to return peers faster, we adjusted announce interval, min announce interval before the adjustment is 15 minutes, and now the shortest min announce interval is 10 minutes. In addition, we also adjusted max peers to 200 (before the adjustment was 100). In order for these adjustments to take effect, we must restart chihaya, which will cause the service to be interrupted for approximately a few seconds. All peers and infohashes data will be lost.</p>

                            <p>With the increase of peers, we found that the existing tracker software (bittorrent-tracker, written in nodejs) cannot meet our requirement, often causing the CPU to run at full load or even down. Therefore, we decided to migrate the tracker to Chihaya. Chihaya is written in golang and has extremely high performance. After testing, under the same circumstances, the CPU usage is less than 1% when using Chihaya. We plan to launch a new server tonight, when there will be a disconnection of about tens of minutes, and all peers and infohashes data will be lost.</p>

                            <p>In order to improve the problem of low efficiency of torrent exchange peers, We opened a dedicated tracker server. The tracker address is (<a href="https://tracker.tamersunion.org/announce">https://tracker.tamersunion.org/announce</a>). From now on, the torrents released by Tamers Union will carry the tracker server by default. At present, all the seeding nodes of Tamers Union have loaded the Tracker. If you encounter the situation that cannot be connected to any node or peer, you can manually add this for this group of seeds Tracker. Note: This Tracker supports both IPV4 and IPV6 peers.</p>
